Data Types and their sizes 
Size of Int : 4
Size of long : 4
Size of float : 4
Size of char : 1
Size of short : 2
Size of bool : 1


while loop check the condition first and then excecute the body of loop 
do while loop excecute the body at first time and then check the condition

contine statement is used to skip the iteration
break statement is used to terminate loop

in i++ the value of i is used first and then  incrementated
and in ++i value of i is used after incrementated

AND Operator & 
OR |
XOR ^
one's compliment ~
left shift Operator <<
right shift Operator >>

a +=b => a= a+b;
a -=b => a = a-b;
a *=b => a = a*b;
a /=b => a = a/b;


Miscellaneous Operator

sixeof
condition ? x:y  => if condition id true then x if not true then y
cast => convert one data type to another data type 
comma(,) => seq of operations to be performed
& => returns address of variable
* => pointer to a variable



Time Complexity
for eg 
for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
{
    statement
}

In this statement time Complexity is proportional to n 


for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
{
    for(i=0;i<=n;i++)
{
    statement
}
}
while in the above statement time Complexity is n^2

O(logn)<O(sqrt(n))<O(n)<O(n^2)<O(n^3)

Space Complexity
dpeneds on Number of Variables 


Worst Case(Big Oh) notation =>proportional to n
Best Case (Big Omega) notation =>constant
Averge case (Big theta) Notation => proportional to n {(n+1)/2}
